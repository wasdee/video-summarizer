> The use of technology in farming has become critical in recent years. Farmers must be aware of the problems that can arise and have the appropriate tools to address them. Technology can help farmers collect data and analyze it to understand how their plants are doing. Drones are increasingly being used to collect spatial data, and the Vettel drone is a new innovation that can fly up and down and control the area more efficiently. Using drones allows farmers to get the data they need, even in cases where satellite photos are not available due to weather conditions. The Vettel drone is made of carbon fiber, which makes it lightweight and easy to control. The drone works with Nomad software, which plans where to cover the area, how to plan the flight, where to take pictures, and collect the data for further analysis. Once farmers have the data, they can use it to see whether the area is well-planned, and plan the area to make it easier for farmers to work. Multi-spectrum data can also be used to determine whether the soil is hard or soft, which is essential for some agricultural projects. Overall, technology is an essential tool that can help farmers address problems and optimize their farmland for maximum yield.

> The speaker begins by talking about the challenges that farmers face today. They say that farmers are under pressure to produce more food with less resources, and that they are also facing the challenge of climate change.
> 
> The speaker then talks about how Vtell's technology can help farmers to address these challenges. They say that Vtell's drones can be used to collect data on plants, which can then be used to identify problems and potential solutions. They also say that Vtell's autonomous vehicles can be used to spray chemicals, deliver heavy goods, and measure the quality of water.
> 
> The speaker concludes by talking about the potential of drone farming and autonomous vehicles to revolutionize the way that farming is done. They say that this technology has the potential to help farmers produce more food with less resources, and that it can also help to protect the environment.
