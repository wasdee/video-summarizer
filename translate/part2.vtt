00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Our concept is not very high-tech.

00:04.000 --> 00:12.000
We have to pay attention to how we take care of our farmland.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
If there's a problem, we always help.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
But if we don't have the tools, it's hard to do it.

00:21.000 --> 00:31.000
When we grow vegetables in a small area, we have to take care of it every day.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Without tools, it's impossible to do it.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
This is where technology comes in handy.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
We collect data on plants.

00:44.000 --> 00:55.000
We use the data to analyze how we can improve our farmland.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Once we understand it, we respond to it.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
We take action.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
If there's a problem, what can we do to fix it?

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
We take action to improve our farmland.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
This is how we collect data.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
This is an example.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
This is a photo of a plant.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
We choose to use a drone photo rather than a satellite photo.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Both have different benefits.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
The satellite photo has all the data in the world.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
But the drone photo has two advantages.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
The first is spatial resolution.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
The second is ground sampling distance.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
The drone photo is 50 cm by 1 pixel.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
We can see the details of the plant.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
The satellite photo is only 15 m by 1 pixel.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
We can't see what's going on in that area.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
We can only see one point.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
It's bigger than the plant itself.

02:19.000 --> 02:29.000
This is a comparison of drone and satellite photos.

02:29.000 --> 02:37.000
We can see that the satellite photo has good and bad grounds.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
But we can't tell what's good or bad about the plant.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
But the drone photo is more detailed.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
We can tell the difference.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
We have more information.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
We can make better decisions.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Another thing is the detail in time.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
The satellite photo doesn't stay in the same place forever.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
It stays in the same place for a day.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
It doesn't mean that we can get the information we want.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
If it rains heavily that day,

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
we will miss the opportunity to get the information.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
We can get the information we want by using a drone.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
What do we use to get the information?

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
I will show you the drone that we developed for space exploration.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
We have seen a drone that can fly up and down and take photos.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
The only limitation is that it can control the area.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
But compared to a plane that uses wings,

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
it has more efficiency.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
It can control the area more.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Vettel is a drone that we developed.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
It can fly up and down.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
There are two advantages.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
It uses less area.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
It's easy to work.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
It can fly up and down.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
If you have seen the video of space exploration,

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
it will be like that.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
It can fly up and down.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
It can fly like a plane.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
It can control the area more.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
It can be used for space exploration.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
It can be used for urban exploration.

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
It can be used for small transportation.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
The drone is made of carbon fiber.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
It is light.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
It is light.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
It can control the area more efficiently.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
You can install an on-board computer to control the communication system.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Whether it is a radio or 4G or 5G,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
you can work with this drone.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
You can work with the drone.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
We have a software to plan where to cover the area,

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
how to plan the flight,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
where to take pictures,

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
and collect the data to assess the results.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Okay.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Now that we have the data,

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
we can analyze it to see if it is useful.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
We can start by preparing the area.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
We can use the photo data to see

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
whether the area is smooth or not.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
We can prepare the paint for the area.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
We can prepare the paint for the area.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
To prepare the paint for a smooth surface,

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
it is easier for the farmer to work.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
It is easier to grow the plants.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
It is easier to take care of the plants.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
The result is better.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
To prepare the area,

06:30.000 --> 06:37.000
some agricultural projects need a smooth surface.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Some projects need a small slope

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
so that the water can flow from the head to the tail.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
It saves money.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
If we have a slope,

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
the water can flow naturally.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
We can use this data to prepare the paint.

06:59.000 --> 07:09.000
Next, we can use the multi-spectrum data

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
to see if the plant is healthy or not.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
We can see if there is any disease or not.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
We can analyze it in detail.

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
We can see if this zone is dehydrated

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
or if there is a disease.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
This zone may have a bug.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
In addition to seeing the strength,

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
we can also use the model to analyze.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
For example,

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
we can evaluate the sweetness of the plant.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
It is called the Khabrix.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
The middle picture is the normal color picture.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
The left picture is the result.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
It shows the sweetness of the sugar.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
The right picture shows the height of the plant.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
How much volume does the paint have?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
How many tons will it produce?

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
If we know the content of the sugar,

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
we can evaluate the sugar content of the paint.

08:19.000 --> 08:26.000
This is another picture.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
If we keep the data consistently,

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
we can know the content of the sugar.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Is it increasing or decreasing?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Is it at the right point?

08:39.000 --> 08:46.000
Does the paint have a constant sweetness value?

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Once we have the data,

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
we can plan how to respond to it.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
We can see if the plant is dehydrated,

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
or if there is a disease.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
We can take care of the spot.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
If we don't have the data,

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
we may have to water the plant.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
It is a high cost.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
It is difficult to take care of the plant.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
If we give a lot of chemicals,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
the plant may be dehydrated.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
But if we know that the plant has a need,

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
we can add more chemicals to the plant.

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
We can evaluate the plant.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
If we plant a lot of paints,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
we can keep the data.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
We can plan how much the paint has been produced.

09:57.000 --> 10:05.000
We can plan when the paint is ready to be produced.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
We can plan when the paint is ready to be produced.

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
If the plant is dehydrated,

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
but the paint is ready to be produced,

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
we don't have to wait.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
We can keep the paint before it is damaged.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
Another benefit is that

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
there is a tendency to burn the paint.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Do farmers want to burn the paint?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
They don't want to burn the paint.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
Burning the paint makes the product worse.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
But there is a period when the paint has to be kept.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
But they don't have the tools.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Everyone wants to keep the paint at the same time to sell.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
The demand for chemicals is increasing.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
If the paint cannot be kept,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
it is not useful.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
There is a tendency to burn the paint.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
But if we have the tools,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
we can plan how to keep the paint.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
We can plan when to keep the paint.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
We can plan when to use the tools.

11:17.000 --> 11:25.000
We can reduce the problem of chemical degradation during that period.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Next is the action.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
We know that if we have to give the chemicals,

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
we can use the drone to help us.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
We can use the drone to help us.

12:01.000 --> 12:09.000
This is the drone that we developed.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
We developed this drone to spray the chemicals.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
It has 10 liters of chemicals.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
It is a multi-rotor drone.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
It has 4 blades.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
It has a chemical tank.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
It has a tank and a spray head.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
We can choose which type of plant to spray.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
How many spray heads should be used?

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
We can choose the type of plants.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
We can choose which type of plants to spray.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
How fast should we spray?

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
We can control the amount of water and give the right amount of water.

12:55.000 --> 13:03.000
We developed the plane software to interact with the farmers,

13:03.000 --> 13:10.000
so that they can learn how to work together and use.

13:10.000 --> 13:21.000
They can use the software and calculate how they have to use the chemicals and how much the chemical spray area has to be used.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
They can calculate how much chemical spray they have to use,

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
how much battery and chemical spray they have to use,

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
how much water they have to fill,

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
and how much chemical spray they have to use.

13:39.000 --> 13:46.000
The software helps them to calculate and inform the farmers.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
They can use the software and calculate how much chemical spray they have to use.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
The software helps them to calculate and inform the farmers.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
The software allows us to control the aircraft accurately.

14:00.000 --> 14:09.000
We can always spray the chemicals and increase the amount of chemical spray to some point.

14:09.000 --> 14:17.000
The software can control the aircraft accurately.

14:17.000 --> 14:30.000
The software can control the aircraft accurately.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
In the case of a large area that cannot be controlled in time,

14:36.000 --> 14:44.000
the software can work together and send the flight plan to the aircraft.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
It saves time and effort.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
It saves time and effort.

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
It saves time and effort.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
We can see that it's better than humans.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
The aircraft can work faster than humans.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
So far, no one has to spray the chemicals on their own.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
So far, no one has to spray the chemicals on their own.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
So far, no one has to spray the chemicals on their own.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
We can also create more jobs for them.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
The farmers don't have to spray the chemicals on their own.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
They hire the workers.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
The employers can work more in a day.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
In addition to our commercial drones,

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
we also have other autonomous vehicles

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
that can do other kinds of work or experiments

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
that currently do not use agriculture,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
but can use agriculture.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Okay.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
This is an autonomous vehicle

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
that can work in different places instead of humans.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
For example, it can deliver heavy goods

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
and work in a farm

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
so that we don't have to risk contact with the world or animals.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
It can also work in a mine

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
to measure and collect data

16:27.000 --> 16:33.000
or spray the chemicals on the plants.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
It's an autonomous vehicle

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
that can work in different places instead of humans.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Okay.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Or it can work in the seawater.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
We can also have a boat

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
that can plan the depth of the water

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
and the area where it can release and collect the water.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
It can plan the amount of water

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
that will be collected in the rain.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
Or it can use it to check the quality of water

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
and measure the quality of water

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
to see how dirty the water is

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
and see if there are any pathogens.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
It can also use it to monitor the water quality

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
to monitor the water quality of the water.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
The boat can be used to plan the depth of the water

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
and measure the quality of water.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
It's similar to a drone.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
We can plan the area that we want it to explore

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
and how we want it to control the area

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
and how we want it to collect the data.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Okay.

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
The boat can also be used to measure the depth of the water.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
It can measure the depth of the water

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
and see how deep it is.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
It can also plan the depth of the water

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
and see how deep it is.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
It can also combine the data with the weather forecast

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
to plan the weather forecast

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
for both upstream and downstream.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Okay.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
The submarine can also be used

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
to plan the weather forecast for both upstream and downstream.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Okay.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
We didn't make this model for research purposes.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
At first, we made this model for research purposes

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
to study the gas pipeline in the South China Sea.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
But when it works in the water,

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
it can also actually work with water pets in the sea.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
Nowadays, there is a system to take care of the seagrasses in the sea.

20:29.000 --> 20:35.000
It can monitor the water pets in the sea as well as the water bodies in the sea.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
This model can be used to conduct research

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
and be tested using various devices

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
to study the water area,

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
gather photos, study its variations, etc.

20:48.000 --> 20:56.000
This is a software that can be tested in the sea.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
This is a picture of how it works.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
It can measure various values

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
and send it back to the surface of the water

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
so that we don't have to go down to work under the water.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
This is a picture of how it works.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
It can measure the value of the water area.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
This is a picture of how it works.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
It can measure the value of the water area.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
This is a picture of how it works.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
This is a picture of how it works.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
This is an example of various autonomous systems

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
that can help us.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
To sum up,

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
we believe that

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
we believe that 1 plus 1 equals 2.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
We believe that

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
the autonomous technology can work with people

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
with different strengths.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
It can work with people with more than just 2.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
It can work with people with more resources.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
It can work with people with better decision-making skills.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
It can work with people with better decision-making skills.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
It can work with people with better decision-making skills.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
It can work with people with better decision-making skills.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
By combining people's abilities

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
by combining people's abilities

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
with the cars' abilities,

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
we can solve a lot of problems.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
That's it.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
I have two questions.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
The drone service is for selling images.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
The drone service is for selling images.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
Do you have a drone service?

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
We don't have a drone service.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
We sell drones

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
and promote image marketing.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
The customer can buy our drones

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
or use their drones.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
We can upload images to the system

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
and sell them.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
You have a drone service

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
that sells images.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
Do you have a drone service?

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
I've seen a drone service

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
that sells images.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
How do you use the drone service?

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
Do you use the data service?

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
As far as I know,

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
there's a drone service

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
that recounts images.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
I'm not sure what kind of images

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
they use.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
I'm not sure.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
Do you have a drone service?

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
Do you have a drone service?

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
Do you have a drone service?

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Do you have a drone service?

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
Do you have a drone service?

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
Do you have a drone service?

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
As far as I know,

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
our customers use the service in their own area.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
We don't run the service for others.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
Do you have a drone service?

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
Do you have a drone service?

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
I'm not sure.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
As far as I know,

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
our customers use the service in their own area.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
As far as I know,

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
our customers use the service in their own area.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
As far as I know,

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
we don't have a drone service.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
We don't have a drone service.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
We use our own data.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
It's not that big.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
It's not that big.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
It's not that big.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
This is a feedback.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
In case we have a chance to meet someone who does this job.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Or we might have a partner to continue this treatment.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
Or we might have a partner to continue this treatment.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
If we say we want people to know

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
If we say we want people to know

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
then they will get encouragement from us.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
They'll talk to me first when this problem occurs.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
I have a person who is interested in this.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
I have a person who is interested in this.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
I mean if I heard that there are orbit wires in this area,

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
I mean if I heard that there are orbit wires in this area,

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
I'd like to use that to check to see if it'd be problematic

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
I'd like to use that to check to see if it'd be problematic

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
Mr.Tumpaksit was working on an area

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
I've talked to the TGO about carbon credit

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
I've talked to the TGO about carbon credit

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
They still have to deliver the wood

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
They still have to deliver the wood

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
to calculate the carbon credit

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
So I'm trying these

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
I'd like to ask as a producer

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
if there are any customers who want to use it for service

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
if there are any customers who want to use it for service

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
Safer and more distributed

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
Safer and more distributed

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
You'll see it in the class

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
you'll see it in the class

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
There are many version of it

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
There are many version of it

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I have a question

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
There are many customers who don't know much about technology

28:00.000 --> 28:06.000
Can they use any services related to technology?

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Can they use any services related to technology?

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
I can answer that

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
If you ask me if there are people who don't know much about technology

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
I don't want to look down on them

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
I think they are not that high-tech

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I think they are not that high-tech

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
4-5 years ago, it was like that

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
But now, everyone has a mobile phone

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
They receive information via social media

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
They watch TikTok

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
Many economists have TikTok

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
They follow each other

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
Most of the economists are in technology

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
When we work with economists

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
We know their workflow

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
We design software to make it easy to use

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
We make menus in Thai

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
We make menus in Thai

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
In comparison to other countries, like Wat

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
In other countries, it's Hector

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
In Thailand, we use Wale

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
We make calculations in Thai

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
We make calculations in Thai

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
We make calculations in Thai

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
We make calculations in Thai

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
We make calculations in Thai

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
Can I ask you a question?

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
If there are people who don't know much about technology

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
Do you have a solution?

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Do you have a solution?

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
Or do you have to get help from new people?

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Or do you have to get help from new people?

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Or do you have to get help from new people?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Partially,

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
Partially,

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
There are things that can be helped

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
They are happy

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
They face problems

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
This is a solution that can be helped

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
They are willing to use it

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
It's easy tools

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
It's not like

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
When we use cellphone

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
It's like downloading data

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
It's just for menus

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
It's not that hard to use

30:12.000 --> 30:19.000
I've never seen a case that can't be used

30:39.000 --> 30:49.000
Thank you

30:57.000 --> 31:02.000
Thank you to all three speakers

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
How was it?

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
Is there anyone interested in doing agri-tech?

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
Thank you everyone for coming

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Thank you for your support

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
Whether it's Protoss, Axon, or 5G

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
Most importantly, I would like to thank Two Digital Credit

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Digital Park, our TDP

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
Today, we've learned a lot about agri-tech

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
Let's take a picture together

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
There are some souvenirs, right?

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
Let's take a look at the speakers

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
It's a T-shirt

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
There are two events today

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
One is P'Pompawut's Web Friend Day

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
I've already organized two boxes

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
I can't find the right place

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
Let's take a picture together

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Let's take a picture

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Let's take a picture together

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Let's take a picture together
