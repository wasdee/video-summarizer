1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Our concept is not very high-tech.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We have to pay attention to how we take care of our farmland.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If there are any problems, we always cooperate.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But if we don't have the tools, it's hard to do it.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We plant vegetables in small areas.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But if we do it in a big area, we have to take care of all the plants every day.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Without any tools, it's impossible.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is where technology comes in handy.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We collect data on plants.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We analyze the data.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
From the raw data, we analyze it to understand how our plants are doing.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Once we understand it, how do we respond?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How do we take action?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If there are any problems, how do we solve them?

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Then we take action.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is how we collect data.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is an example.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is a photo.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This is a photo of a plant.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We choose to use a drone photo rather than a satellite photo.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Both have different benefits.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Satellites are around the world.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
They get data from all over the world.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There are two points where drone photos are better.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The first is spatial resolution.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The second is ground sampling distance.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is how much a single point of a photo can cover.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If we compare drone photos, we can get 50 cm by 1 pixel.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We can see the details of the plant.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Satellite photos are only 15 m by 1 pixel.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We can't see what's going on in that area.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We can only see one point.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's bigger than the plant itself.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is a comparison of drone and satellite photos.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We can see that the satellite photos are more detailed than the drone photos.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This gives us more information.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We can make better decisions.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Satellite photos don't stay in the same place forever.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
They move around.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
They stay in the same place for a day.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It doesn't mean that we get the data that we want.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If it rains heavily that day, we miss the chance to get the data.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Using a drone allows us to get the data that we want.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What do we use to collect spatial data?

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This is a drone video that we developed for spatial research.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We have seen a drone that can fly up and down.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The limitation is that it can control the area.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But compared to a drone that can fly up and down, it can control the area more efficiently.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Vettel is a drone that we developed.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It can fly up and down.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There are two advantages.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It uses less space.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It is easier to work.

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It can fly up and down.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
If you have seen the video of Space X, it is the same.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It can fly up and down.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It can change the air.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It can fly like an airplane.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It can control the area more efficiently.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It can be used for spatial research.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It can be used for urban planning.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It can be used to transport small goods.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The drone is made of carbon fiber.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It is light and can be used to control the area.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We can install on-board computers to control the communication system.

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Whether it is using 4G or 5G, we can work together with this drone.

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The drone works with Nomad.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We have a software to plan where to cover the area,

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
how to plan the flight,

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
where to take pictures,

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and collect the data for further analysis.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Once we have the data, we can use it for analysis.

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We can use the data to see whether the area is well-planned.

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
We can plan the area to make it easier for farmers to work.

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We can plan the area to make it easier for farmers to work.

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Some agricultural projects require a well-planned area.

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Some agricultural projects require a well-planned area.

78
00:06:44,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We can use the multi-spectrum data to see whether the soil is hard or soft.

79
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
