1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Our concept is not very high-tech.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We have to pay attention to how we take care of our farmland.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If there's a problem, we always help.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But if we don't have the tools, it's hard to do it.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,000
When we grow vegetables in a small area, we have to take care of it every day.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Without tools, it's impossible to do it.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is where technology comes in handy.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We collect data on plants.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We use the data to analyze how we can improve our farmland.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Once we understand it, we respond to it.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We take action.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If there's a problem, what can we do to fix it?

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We take action to improve our farmland.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is how we collect data.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is an example.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This is a photo of a plant.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We choose to use a drone photo rather than a satellite photo.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Both have different benefits.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The satellite photo has all the data in the world.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But the drone photo has two advantages.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The first is spatial resolution.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The second is ground sampling distance.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The drone photo is 50 cm by 1 pixel.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We can see the details of the plant.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The satellite photo is only 15 m by 1 pixel.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We can't see what's going on in that area.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We can only see one point.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's bigger than the plant itself.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is a comparison of drone and satellite photos.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We can see that the satellite photo has good and bad grounds.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But we can't tell what's good or bad about the plant.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But the drone photo is more detailed.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We can tell the difference.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We have more information.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We can make better decisions.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Another thing is the detail in time.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The satellite photo doesn't stay in the same place forever.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It stays in the same place for a day.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It doesn't mean that we can get the information we want.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If it rains heavily that day,

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
we will miss the opportunity to get the information.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We can get the information we want by using a drone.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What do we use to get the information?

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I will show you the drone that we developed for space exploration.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We have seen a drone that can fly up and down and take photos.

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The only limitation is that it can control the area.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But compared to a plane that uses wings,

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
it has more efficiency.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It can control the area more.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Vettel is a drone that we developed.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It can fly up and down.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There are two advantages.

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It uses less area.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's easy to work.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It can fly up and down.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If you have seen the video of space exploration,

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
it will be like that.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It can fly up and down.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It can fly like a plane.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It can control the area more.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It can be used for space exploration.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It can be used for urban exploration.

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It can be used for small transportation.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The drone is made of carbon fiber.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It is light.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It is light.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It can control the area more efficiently.

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You can install an on-board computer to control the communication system.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Whether it is a radio or 4G or 5G,

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
you can work with this drone.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You can work with the drone.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We have a software to plan where to cover the area,

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
how to plan the flight,

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
where to take pictures,

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and collect the data to assess the results.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay.

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Now that we have the data,

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
we can analyze it to see if it is useful.

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We can start by preparing the area.

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We can use the photo data to see

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
whether the area is smooth or not.

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We can prepare the paint for the area.

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We can prepare the paint for the area.

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
To prepare the paint for a smooth surface,

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
it is easier for the farmer to work.

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It is easier to grow the plants.

87
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It is easier to take care of the plants.

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The result is better.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
To prepare the area,

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
some agricultural projects need a smooth surface.

91
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Some projects need a small slope

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
so that the water can flow from the head to the tail.

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It saves money.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
If we have a slope,

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
the water can flow naturally.

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We can use this data to prepare the paint.

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Next, we can use the multi-spectrum data

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
to see if the plant is healthy or not.

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We can see if there is any disease or not.

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We can analyze it in detail.

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We can see if this zone is dehydrated

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
or if there is a disease.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This zone may have a bug.

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
In addition to seeing the strength,

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
we can also use the model to analyze.

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
For example,

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
we can evaluate the sweetness of the plant.

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It is called the Khabrix.

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The middle picture is the normal color picture.

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The left picture is the result.

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It shows the sweetness of the sugar.

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The right picture shows the height of the plant.

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
How much volume does the paint have?

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
How many tons will it produce?

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If we know the content of the sugar,

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
we can evaluate the sugar content of the paint.

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This is another picture.

118
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If we keep the data consistently,

119
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
we can know the content of the sugar.

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Is it increasing or decreasing?

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Is it at the right point?

122
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Does the paint have a constant sweetness value?

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Once we have the data,

124
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
we can plan how to respond to it.

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We can see if the plant is dehydrated,

126
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
or if there is a disease.

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We can take care of the spot.

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
If we don't have the data,

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
we may have to water the plant.

130
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It is a high cost.

131
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It is difficult to take care of the plant.

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
If we give a lot of chemicals,

133
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
the plant may be dehydrated.

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But if we know that the plant has a need,

135
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
we can add more chemicals to the plant.

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We can evaluate the plant.

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
If we plant a lot of paints,

138
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
we can keep the data.

139
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We can plan how much the paint has been produced.

140
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We can plan when the paint is ready to be produced.

141
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We can plan when the paint is ready to be produced.

142
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
If the plant is dehydrated,

143
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
but the paint is ready to be produced,

144
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
we don't have to wait.

145
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We can keep the paint before it is damaged.

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Another benefit is that

147
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
there is a tendency to burn the paint.

148
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Do farmers want to burn the paint?

149
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
They don't want to burn the paint.

150
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Burning the paint makes the product worse.

151
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But there is a period when the paint has to be kept.

152
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But they don't have the tools.

153
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Everyone wants to keep the paint at the same time to sell.

154
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The demand for chemicals is increasing.

155
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If the paint cannot be kept,

156
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
it is not useful.

157
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
There is a tendency to burn the paint.

158
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But if we have the tools,

159
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
we can plan how to keep the paint.

160
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We can plan when to keep the paint.

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We can plan when to use the tools.

162
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
We can reduce the problem of chemical degradation during that period.

163
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Next is the action.

164
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We know that if we have to give the chemicals,

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
we can use the drone to help us.

166
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We can use the drone to help us.

167
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,000
This is the drone that we developed.

168
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
We developed this drone to spray the chemicals.

169
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It has 10 liters of chemicals.

170
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It is a multi-rotor drone.

171
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It has 4 blades.

172
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It has a chemical tank.

173
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It has a tank and a spray head.

174
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
We can choose which type of plant to spray.

175
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
How many spray heads should be used?

176
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We can choose the type of plants.

177
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We can choose which type of plants to spray.

178
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
How fast should we spray?

179
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We can control the amount of water and give the right amount of water.

180
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We developed the plane software to interact with the farmers,

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
so that they can learn how to work together and use.

182
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:21,000
They can use the software and calculate how they have to use the chemicals and how much the chemical spray area has to be used.

183
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
They can calculate how much chemical spray they have to use,

184
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
how much battery and chemical spray they have to use,

185
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
how much water they have to fill,

186
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and how much chemical spray they have to use.

187
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The software helps them to calculate and inform the farmers.

188
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
They can use the software and calculate how much chemical spray they have to use.

189
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The software helps them to calculate and inform the farmers.

190
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The software allows us to control the aircraft accurately.

191
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:09,000
We can always spray the chemicals and increase the amount of chemical spray to some point.

192
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The software can control the aircraft accurately.

193
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The software can control the aircraft accurately.

194
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
In the case of a large area that cannot be controlled in time,

195
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,000
the software can work together and send the flight plan to the aircraft.

196
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It saves time and effort.

197
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It saves time and effort.

198
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It saves time and effort.

199
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
We can see that it's better than humans.

200
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The aircraft can work faster than humans.

201
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So far, no one has to spray the chemicals on their own.

202
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So far, no one has to spray the chemicals on their own.

203
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So far, no one has to spray the chemicals on their own.

204
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We can also create more jobs for them.

205
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The farmers don't have to spray the chemicals on their own.

206
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
They hire the workers.

207
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The employers can work more in a day.

208
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
In addition to our commercial drones,

209
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
we also have other autonomous vehicles

210
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
that can do other kinds of work or experiments

211
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
that currently do not use agriculture,

212
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
but can use agriculture.

213
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Okay.

214
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
This is an autonomous vehicle

215
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
that can work in different places instead of humans.

216
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
For example, it can deliver heavy goods

217
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and work in a farm

218
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
so that we don't have to risk contact with the world or animals.

219
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It can also work in a mine

220
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
to measure and collect data

221
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
or spray the chemicals on the plants.

222
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's an autonomous vehicle

223
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
that can work in different places instead of humans.

224
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Okay.

225
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Or it can work in the seawater.

226
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
We can also have a boat

227
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
that can plan the depth of the water

228
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and the area where it can release and collect the water.

229
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It can plan the amount of water

230
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
that will be collected in the rain.

231
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Or it can use it to check the quality of water

232
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and measure the quality of water

233
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
to see how dirty the water is

234
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and see if there are any pathogens.

235
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It can also use it to monitor the water quality

236
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
to monitor the water quality of the water.

237
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The boat can be used to plan the depth of the water

238
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
and measure the quality of water.

239
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's similar to a drone.

240
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
We can plan the area that we want it to explore

241
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and how we want it to control the area

242
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and how we want it to collect the data.

243
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Okay.

244
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The boat can also be used to measure the depth of the water.

245
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It can measure the depth of the water

246
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
and see how deep it is.

247
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It can also plan the depth of the water

248
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and see how deep it is.

249
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It can also combine the data with the weather forecast

250
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
to plan the weather forecast

251
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
for both upstream and downstream.

252
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Okay.

253
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The submarine can also be used

254
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
to plan the weather forecast for both upstream and downstream.

255
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Okay.

256
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
We didn't make this model for research purposes.

257
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
At first, we made this model for research purposes

258
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
to study the gas pipeline in the South China Sea.

259
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But when it works in the water,

260
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
it can also actually work with water pets in the sea.

261
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Nowadays, there is a system to take care of the seagrasses in the sea.

262
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It can monitor the water pets in the sea as well as the water bodies in the sea.

263
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
This model can be used to conduct research

264
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and be tested using various devices

265
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
to study the water area,

266
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
gather photos, study its variations, etc.

267
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This is a software that can be tested in the sea.

268
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
This is a picture of how it works.

269
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It can measure various values

270
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
and send it back to the surface of the water

271
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
so that we don't have to go down to work under the water.

272
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
This is a picture of how it works.

273
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It can measure the value of the water area.

274
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
This is a picture of how it works.

275
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It can measure the value of the water area.

276
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
This is a picture of how it works.

277
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
This is a picture of how it works.

278
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
This is an example of various autonomous systems

279
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
that can help us.

280
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
To sum up,

281
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
we believe that

282
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
we believe that 1 plus 1 equals 2.

283
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
We believe that

284
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
the autonomous technology can work with people

285
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
with different strengths.

286
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It can work with people with more than just 2.

287
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It can work with people with more resources.

288
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It can work with people with better decision-making skills.

289
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It can work with people with better decision-making skills.

290
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It can work with people with better decision-making skills.

291
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It can work with people with better decision-making skills.

292
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
By combining people's abilities

293
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
by combining people's abilities

294
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
with the cars' abilities,

295
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
we can solve a lot of problems.

296
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That's it.

297
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

298
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I have two questions.

299
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The drone service is for selling images.

300
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
The drone service is for selling images.

301
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Do you have a drone service?

302
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
We don't have a drone service.

303
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
We sell drones

304
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and promote image marketing.

305
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The customer can buy our drones

306
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
or use their drones.

307
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
We can upload images to the system

308
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and sell them.

309
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You have a drone service

310
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
that sells images.

311
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Do you have a drone service?

312
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I've seen a drone service

313
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
that sells images.

314
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
How do you use the drone service?

315
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Do you use the data service?

316
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
As far as I know,

317
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
there's a drone service

318
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
that recounts images.

319
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm not sure what kind of images

320
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
they use.

321
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm not sure.

322
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Do you have a drone service?

323
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Do you have a drone service?

324
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Do you have a drone service?

325
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Do you have a drone service?

326
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Do you have a drone service?

327
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Do you have a drone service?

328
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
As far as I know,

329
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
our customers use the service in their own area.

330
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
We don't run the service for others.

331
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Do you have a drone service?

332
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Do you have a drone service?

333
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm not sure.

334
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
As far as I know,

335
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
our customers use the service in their own area.

336
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
As far as I know,

337
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
our customers use the service in their own area.

338
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
As far as I know,

339
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
we don't have a drone service.

340
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We don't have a drone service.

341
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
We use our own data.

342
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's not that big.

343
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's not that big.

344
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It's not that big.

345
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
This is a feedback.

346
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
In case we have a chance to meet someone who does this job.

347
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Or we might have a partner to continue this treatment.

348
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Or we might have a partner to continue this treatment.

349
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
If we say we want people to know

350
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
If we say we want people to know

351
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
then they will get encouragement from us.

352
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
They'll talk to me first when this problem occurs.

353
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I have a person who is interested in this.

354
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I have a person who is interested in this.

355
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I mean if I heard that there are orbit wires in this area,

356
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I mean if I heard that there are orbit wires in this area,

357
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'd like to use that to check to see if it'd be problematic

358
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'd like to use that to check to see if it'd be problematic

359
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Mr.Tumpaksit was working on an area

360
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I've talked to the TGO about carbon credit

361
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I've talked to the TGO about carbon credit

362
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
They still have to deliver the wood

363
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
They still have to deliver the wood

364
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
to calculate the carbon credit

365
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So I'm trying these

366
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'd like to ask as a producer

367
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
if there are any customers who want to use it for service

368
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
if there are any customers who want to use it for service

369
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Safer and more distributed

370
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Safer and more distributed

371
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You'll see it in the class

372
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
you'll see it in the class

373
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
There are many version of it

374
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
There are many version of it

375
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I have a question

376
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
There are many customers who don't know much about technology

377
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Can they use any services related to technology?

378
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Can they use any services related to technology?

379
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I can answer that

380
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
If you ask me if there are people who don't know much about technology

381
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I don't want to look down on them

382
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I think they are not that high-tech

383
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I think they are not that high-tech

384
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
4-5 years ago, it was like that

385
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But now, everyone has a mobile phone

386
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
They receive information via social media

387
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
They watch TikTok

388
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Many economists have TikTok

389
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
They follow each other

390
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Most of the economists are in technology

391
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
When we work with economists

392
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
We know their workflow

393
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
We design software to make it easy to use

394
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
We make menus in Thai

395
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We make menus in Thai

396
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
In comparison to other countries, like Wat

397
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
In other countries, it's Hector

398
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
In Thailand, we use Wale

399
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
We make calculations in Thai

400
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
We make calculations in Thai

401
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
We make calculations in Thai

402
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
We make calculations in Thai

403
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
We make calculations in Thai

404
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Can I ask you a question?

405
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
If there are people who don't know much about technology

406
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Do you have a solution?

407
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Do you have a solution?

408
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Or do you have to get help from new people?

409
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Or do you have to get help from new people?

410
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Or do you have to get help from new people?

411
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Partially,

412
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Partially,

413
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
There are things that can be helped

414
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
They are happy

415
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
They face problems

416
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
This is a solution that can be helped

417
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
They are willing to use it

418
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It's easy tools

419
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It's not like

420
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
When we use cellphone

421
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It's like downloading data

422
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
It's just for menus

423
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's not that hard to use

424
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I've never seen a case that can't be used

425
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Thank you

426
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Thank you to all three speakers

427
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
How was it?

428
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Is there anyone interested in doing agri-tech?

429
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Thank you everyone for coming

430
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Thank you for your support

431
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Whether it's Protoss, Axon, or 5G

432
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Most importantly, I would like to thank Two Digital Credit

433
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Digital Park, our TDP

434
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Today, we've learned a lot about agri-tech

435
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Let's take a picture together

436
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
There are some souvenirs, right?

437
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Let's take a look at the speakers

438
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It's a T-shirt

439
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
There are two events today

440
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
One is P'Pompawut's Web Friend Day

441
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I've already organized two boxes

442
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I can't find the right place

443
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Let's take a picture together

444
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Let's take a picture

445
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Let's take a picture together

446
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Let's take a picture together
