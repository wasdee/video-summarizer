0	4000	Our concept is not very high-tech.
4000	12000	We have to pay attention to how we take care of our farmland.
12000	15000	If there's a problem, we always help.
15000	21000	But if we don't have the tools, it's hard to do it.
21000	31000	When we grow vegetables in a small area, we have to take care of it every day.
31000	35000	Without tools, it's impossible to do it.
35000	38000	This is where technology comes in handy.
38000	44000	We collect data on plants.
44000	55000	We use the data to analyze how we can improve our farmland.
55000	58000	Once we understand it, we respond to it.
58000	60000	We take action.
60000	63000	If there's a problem, what can we do to fix it?
63000	69000	We take action to improve our farmland.
70000	76000	This is how we collect data.
76000	78000	This is an example.
78000	83000	This is a photo of a plant.
83000	88000	We choose to use a drone photo rather than a satellite photo.
88000	92000	Both have different benefits.
92000	95000	The satellite photo has all the data in the world.
95000	100000	But the drone photo has two advantages.
100000	105000	The first is spatial resolution.
105000	112000	The second is ground sampling distance.
112000	118000	The drone photo is 50 cm by 1 pixel.
118000	121000	We can see the details of the plant.
121000	127000	The satellite photo is only 15 m by 1 pixel.
127000	131000	We can't see what's going on in that area.
131000	133000	We can only see one point.
133000	135000	It's bigger than the plant itself.
139000	149000	This is a comparison of drone and satellite photos.
149000	157000	We can see that the satellite photo has good and bad grounds.
157000	161000	But we can't tell what's good or bad about the plant.
161000	163000	But the drone photo is more detailed.
163000	165000	We can tell the difference.
165000	167000	We have more information.
167000	169000	We can make better decisions.
173000	175000	Another thing is the detail in time.
175000	179000	The satellite photo doesn't stay in the same place forever.
179000	184000	It stays in the same place for a day.
184000	188000	It doesn't mean that we can get the information we want.
188000	192000	If it rains heavily that day,
192000	196000	we will miss the opportunity to get the information.
196000	203000	We can get the information we want by using a drone.
206000	212000	What do we use to get the information?
212000	220000	I will show you the drone that we developed for space exploration.
226000	233000	We have seen a drone that can fly up and down and take photos.
233000	237000	The only limitation is that it can control the area.
237000	240000	But compared to a plane that uses wings,
240000	242000	it has more efficiency.
242000	244000	It can control the area more.
244000	247000	Vettel is a drone that we developed.
247000	250000	It can fly up and down.
250000	254000	There are two advantages.
254000	255000	It uses less area.
255000	256000	It's easy to work.
256000	257000	It can fly up and down.
257000	259000	If you have seen the video of space exploration,
259000	260000	it will be like that.
260000	261000	It can fly up and down.
261000	265000	It can fly like a plane.
265000	267000	It can control the area more.
267000	272000	It can be used for space exploration.
272000	275000	It can be used for urban exploration.
275000	282000	It can be used for small transportation.
282000	286000	The drone is made of carbon fiber.
286000	287000	It is light.
287000	288000	It is light.
288000	292000	It can control the area more efficiently.
296000	301000	You can install an on-board computer to control the communication system.
301000	305000	Whether it is a radio or 4G or 5G,
305000	308000	you can work with this drone.
318000	320000	You can work with the drone.
320000	325000	We have a software to plan where to cover the area,
325000	326000	how to plan the flight,
326000	328000	where to take pictures,
328000	331000	and collect the data to assess the results.
348000	349000	Okay.
349000	351000	Now that we have the data,
351000	354000	we can analyze it to see if it is useful.
354000	358000	We can start by preparing the area.
358000	363000	We can use the photo data to see
363000	367000	whether the area is smooth or not.
367000	371000	We can prepare the paint for the area.
371000	374000	We can prepare the paint for the area.
374000	378000	To prepare the paint for a smooth surface,
378000	381000	it is easier for the farmer to work.
381000	384000	It is easier to grow the plants.
384000	386000	It is easier to take care of the plants.
386000	387000	The result is better.
387000	390000	To prepare the area,
390000	397000	some agricultural projects need a smooth surface.
397000	400000	Some projects need a small slope
400000	404000	so that the water can flow from the head to the tail.
404000	410000	It saves money.
410000	411000	If we have a slope,
411000	415000	the water can flow naturally.
415000	419000	We can use this data to prepare the paint.
419000	429000	Next, we can use the multi-spectrum data
429000	434000	to see if the plant is healthy or not.
434000	438000	We can see if there is any disease or not.
438000	441000	We can analyze it in detail.
441000	447000	We can see if this zone is dehydrated
447000	449000	or if there is a disease.
449000	451000	This zone may have a bug.
456000	458000	In addition to seeing the strength,
458000	462000	we can also use the model to analyze.
462000	463000	For example,
463000	469000	we can evaluate the sweetness of the plant.
469000	471000	It is called the Khabrix.
471000	474000	The middle picture is the normal color picture.
474000	476000	The left picture is the result.
476000	480000	It shows the sweetness of the sugar.
480000	485000	The right picture shows the height of the plant.
485000	488000	How much volume does the paint have?
488000	490000	How many tons will it produce?
490000	493000	If we know the content of the sugar,
493000	499000	we can evaluate the sugar content of the paint.
499000	506000	This is another picture.
506000	509000	If we keep the data consistently,
509000	515000	we can know the content of the sugar.
515000	517000	Is it increasing or decreasing?
517000	519000	Is it at the right point?
519000	526000	Does the paint have a constant sweetness value?
530000	533000	Once we have the data,
533000	540000	we can plan how to respond to it.
540000	546000	We can see if the plant is dehydrated,
546000	550000	or if there is a disease.
550000	554000	We can take care of the spot.
554000	556000	If we don't have the data,
556000	562000	we may have to water the plant.
562000	565000	It is a high cost.
565000	567000	It is difficult to take care of the plant.
567000	568000	If we give a lot of chemicals,
568000	570000	the plant may be dehydrated.
570000	574000	But if we know that the plant has a need,
574000	580000	we can add more chemicals to the plant.
581000	587000	We can evaluate the plant.
587000	591000	If we plant a lot of paints,
591000	593000	we can keep the data.
593000	597000	We can plan how much the paint has been produced.
597000	605000	We can plan when the paint is ready to be produced.
605000	610000	We can plan when the paint is ready to be produced.
610000	617000	If the plant is dehydrated,
617000	620000	but the paint is ready to be produced,
620000	621000	we don't have to wait.
621000	624000	We can keep the paint before it is damaged.
624000	628000	Another benefit is that
628000	632000	there is a tendency to burn the paint.
632000	635000	Do farmers want to burn the paint?
635000	636000	They don't want to burn the paint.
636000	640000	Burning the paint makes the product worse.
640000	644000	But there is a period when the paint has to be kept.
644000	648000	But they don't have the tools.
648000	651000	Everyone wants to keep the paint at the same time to sell.
651000	655000	The demand for chemicals is increasing.
655000	658000	If the paint cannot be kept,
658000	660000	it is not useful.
660000	666000	There is a tendency to burn the paint.
666000	669000	But if we have the tools,
669000	673000	we can plan how to keep the paint.
673000	675000	We can plan when to keep the paint.
675000	677000	We can plan when to use the tools.
677000	685000	We can reduce the problem of chemical degradation during that period.
691000	694000	Next is the action.
694000	700000	We know that if we have to give the chemicals,
700000	706000	we can use the drone to help us.
706000	712000	We can use the drone to help us.
721000	729000	This is the drone that we developed.
729000	734000	We developed this drone to spray the chemicals.
734000	738000	It has 10 liters of chemicals.
738000	741000	It is a multi-rotor drone.
741000	743000	It has 4 blades.
743000	746000	It has a chemical tank.
746000	749000	It has a tank and a spray head.
749000	755000	We can choose which type of plant to spray.
755000	760000	How many spray heads should be used?
760000	763000	We can choose the type of plants.
763000	768000	We can choose which type of plants to spray.
768000	770000	How fast should we spray?
770000	774000	We can control the amount of water and give the right amount of water.
775000	783000	We developed the plane software to interact with the farmers,
783000	790000	so that they can learn how to work together and use.
790000	801000	They can use the software and calculate how they have to use the chemicals and how much the chemical spray area has to be used.
801000	807000	They can calculate how much chemical spray they have to use,
807000	811000	how much battery and chemical spray they have to use,
811000	816000	how much water they have to fill,
816000	819000	and how much chemical spray they have to use.
819000	826000	The software helps them to calculate and inform the farmers.
826000	831000	They can use the software and calculate how much chemical spray they have to use.
831000	835000	The software helps them to calculate and inform the farmers.
835000	840000	The software allows us to control the aircraft accurately.
840000	849000	We can always spray the chemicals and increase the amount of chemical spray to some point.
849000	857000	The software can control the aircraft accurately.
857000	870000	The software can control the aircraft accurately.
870000	876000	In the case of a large area that cannot be controlled in time,
876000	884000	the software can work together and send the flight plan to the aircraft.
884000	886000	It saves time and effort.
886000	889000	It saves time and effort.
889000	894000	It saves time and effort.
901000	905000	We can see that it's better than humans.
905000	908000	The aircraft can work faster than humans.
908000	912000	So far, no one has to spray the chemicals on their own.
912000	916000	So far, no one has to spray the chemicals on their own.
916000	921000	So far, no one has to spray the chemicals on their own.
923000	925000	We can also create more jobs for them.
925000	927000	The farmers don't have to spray the chemicals on their own.
927000	928000	They hire the workers.
928000	930000	The employers can work more in a day.
937000	941000	In addition to our commercial drones,
941000	945000	we also have other autonomous vehicles
945000	950000	that can do other kinds of work or experiments
950000	952000	that currently do not use agriculture,
952000	954000	but can use agriculture.
955000	956000	Okay.
966000	968000	This is an autonomous vehicle
968000	972000	that can work in different places instead of humans.
972000	976000	For example, it can deliver heavy goods
976000	979000	and work in a farm
979000	983000	so that we don't have to risk contact with the world or animals.
983000	985000	It can also work in a mine
985000	987000	to measure and collect data
987000	993000	or spray the chemicals on the plants.
995000	998000	It's an autonomous vehicle
998000	1002000	that can work in different places instead of humans.
1013000	1014000	Okay.
1017000	1020000	Or it can work in the seawater.
1024000	1027000	We can also have a boat
1033000	1038000	that can plan the depth of the water
1038000	1041000	and the area where it can release and collect the water.
1041000	1044000	It can plan the amount of water
1044000	1047000	that will be collected in the rain.
1048000	1052000	Or it can use it to check the quality of water
1052000	1054000	and measure the quality of water
1054000	1056000	to see how dirty the water is
1056000	1058000	and see if there are any pathogens.
1058000	1063000	It can also use it to monitor the water quality
1063000	1066000	to monitor the water quality of the water.
1066000	1071000	The boat can be used to plan the depth of the water
1071000	1076000	and measure the quality of water.
1096000	1098000	It's similar to a drone.
1098000	1103000	We can plan the area that we want it to explore
1103000	1107000	and how we want it to control the area
1107000	1112000	and how we want it to collect the data.
1112000	1113000	Okay.
1122000	1127000	The boat can also be used to measure the depth of the water.
1127000	1130000	It can measure the depth of the water
1130000	1133000	and see how deep it is.
1133000	1138000	It can also plan the depth of the water
1138000	1144000	and see how deep it is.
1151000	1155000	It can also combine the data with the weather forecast
1155000	1159000	to plan the weather forecast
1159000	1162000	for both upstream and downstream.
1168000	1169000	Okay.
1192000	1195000	The submarine can also be used
1195000	1198000	to plan the weather forecast for both upstream and downstream.
1208000	1209000	Okay.
1209000	1213000	We didn't make this model for research purposes.
1213000	1217000	At first, we made this model for research purposes
1217000	1219000	to study the gas pipeline in the South China Sea.
1219000	1221000	But when it works in the water,
1221000	1225000	it can also actually work with water pets in the sea.
1225000	1229000	Nowadays, there is a system to take care of the seagrasses in the sea.
1229000	1235000	It can monitor the water pets in the sea as well as the water bodies in the sea.
1235000	1239000	This model can be used to conduct research
1239000	1242000	and be tested using various devices
1242000	1245000	to study the water area,
1245000	1248000	gather photos, study its variations, etc.
1248000	1256000	This is a software that can be tested in the sea.
1279000	1282000	This is a picture of how it works.
1282000	1285000	It can measure various values
1285000	1288000	and send it back to the surface of the water
1288000	1292000	so that we don't have to go down to work under the water.
1309000	1312000	This is a picture of how it works.
1312000	1315000	It can measure the value of the water area.
1315000	1318000	This is a picture of how it works.
1318000	1321000	It can measure the value of the water area.
1321000	1324000	This is a picture of how it works.
1324000	1327000	This is a picture of how it works.
1335000	1340000	This is an example of various autonomous systems
1340000	1343000	that can help us.
1344000	1347000	To sum up,
1347000	1350000	we believe that
1350000	1353000	we believe that 1 plus 1 equals 2.
1353000	1356000	We believe that
1356000	1359000	the autonomous technology can work with people
1359000	1362000	with different strengths.
1362000	1365000	It can work with people with more than just 2.
1365000	1368000	It can work with people with more resources.
1368000	1371000	It can work with people with better decision-making skills.
1371000	1374000	It can work with people with better decision-making skills.
1374000	1377000	It can work with people with better decision-making skills.
1377000	1380000	It can work with people with better decision-making skills.
1380000	1383000	By combining people's abilities
1383000	1386000	by combining people's abilities
1386000	1389000	with the cars' abilities,
1389000	1392000	we can solve a lot of problems.
1396000	1399000	That's it.
1399000	1402000	If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
1423000	1426000	I have two questions.
1426000	1429000	The drone service is for selling images.
1429000	1432000	The drone service is for selling images.
1432000	1435000	Do you have a drone service?
1435000	1438000	We don't have a drone service.
1438000	1441000	We sell drones
1441000	1444000	and promote image marketing.
1444000	1447000	The customer can buy our drones
1447000	1450000	or use their drones.
1450000	1453000	We can upload images to the system
1453000	1456000	and sell them.
1459000	1462000	You have a drone service
1462000	1465000	that sells images.
1465000	1468000	Do you have a drone service?
1468000	1471000	I've seen a drone service

1489000	1492000	I'm not sure what kind of images
1492000	1495000	they use.
1495000	1498000	I'm not sure.

1567000	1570000	It's not that big.
1570000	1573000	It's not that big.
1573000	1576000	This is a feedback.
1576000	1579000	In case we have a chance to meet someone who does this job.
1579000	1582000	Or we might have a partner to continue this treatment.
1582000	1585000	Or we might have a partner to continue this treatment.
1585000	1588000	If we say we want people to know
1588000	1590000	If we say we want people to know
1590000	1593000	then they will get encouragement from us.
1593000	1596000	They'll talk to me first when this problem occurs.
1596000	1599000	I have a person who is interested in this.
1599000	1602000	I have a person who is interested in this.
1602000	1605000	I mean if I heard that there are orbit wires in this area,
1605000	1608000	I mean if I heard that there are orbit wires in this area,
1608000	1611000	I'd like to use that to check to see if it'd be problematic
1611000	1614000	I'd like to use that to check to see if it'd be problematic
1614000	1618000	Mr.Tumpaksit was working on an area
1619000	1622000	I've talked to the TGO about carbon credit
1622000	1625000	I've talked to the TGO about carbon credit
1625000	1628000	They still have to deliver the wood
1628000	1631000	They still have to deliver the wood
1631000	1634000	to calculate the carbon credit
1634000	1637000	So I'm trying these
1637000	1640000	I'd like to ask as a producer
1640000	1643000	if there are any customers who want to use it for service
1643000	1646000	if there are any customers who want to use it for service
1646000	1650000	Safer and more distributed
1650000	1653000	Safer and more distributed
1653000	1656000	You'll see it in the class
1656000	1659000	you'll see it in the class
1668000	1672000	There are many version of it
1672000	1675000	There are many version of it
1675000	1677000	I have a question
1677000	1680000	There are many customers who don't know much about technology
1680000	1686000	Can they use any services related to technology?
1686000	1688000	Can they use any services related to technology?
1688000	1692000	I can answer that
1692000	1696000	If you ask me if there are people who don't know much about technology
1696000	1700000	I don't want to look down on them
1700000	1704000	I think they are not that high-tech
1704000	1706000	I think they are not that high-tech
1706000	1708000	4-5 years ago, it was like that
1708000	1711000	But now, everyone has a mobile phone
1711000	1713000	They receive information via social media
1713000	1716000	They watch TikTok
1716000	1720000	Many economists have TikTok
1720000	1723000	They follow each other
1723000	1727000	Most of the economists are in technology
1727000	1732000	When we work with economists
1732000	1735000	We know their workflow
1735000	1738000	We design software to make it easy to use
1738000	1740000	We make menus in Thai
1740000	1741000	We make menus in Thai
1741000	1744000	In comparison to other countries, like Wat
1744000	1746000	In other countries, it's Hector
1746000	1748000	In Thailand, we use Wale
1748000	1750000	We make calculations in Thai
1750000	1751000	We make calculations in Thai
1751000	1752000	We make calculations in Thai

1753000	1754000	We make calculations in Thai
1755000	1759000	Can I ask you a question?
1759000	1763000	If there are people who don't know much about technology
1763000	1766000	Do you have a solution?
1766000	1768000	Do you have a solution?
1768000	1771000	Or do you have to get help from new people?
1771000	1773000	Or do you have to get help from new people?
1773000	1775000	Or do you have to get help from new people?
1775000	1777000	Partially,
1777000	1781000	Partially,

1796000	1799000	It's easy tools
1799000	1802000	It's not like
1802000	1804000	When we use cellphone
1804000	1806000	It's like downloading data
1806000	1809000	It's just for menus
1809000	1812000	It's not that hard to use
1812000	1819000	I've never seen a case that can't be used
