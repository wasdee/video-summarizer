00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Our concept is not very high-tech.

00:04.000 --> 00:12.000
We have to pay attention to how we take care of our farmland.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
If there are any problems, we always cooperate.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
But if we don't have the tools, it's hard to do it.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
We plant vegetables in small areas.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
But if we do it in a big area, we have to take care of all the plants every day.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Without any tools, it's impossible.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
This is where technology comes in handy.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
We collect data on plants.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
We analyze the data.

00:46.000 --> 00:55.000
From the raw data, we analyze it to understand how our plants are doing.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Once we understand it, how do we respond?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
How do we take action?

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
If there are any problems, how do we solve them?

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
Then we take action.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
This is how we collect data.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
This is an example.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
This is a photo.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
This is a photo of a plant.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
We choose to use a drone photo rather than a satellite photo.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Both have different benefits.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Satellites are around the world.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
They get data from all over the world.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
There are two points where drone photos are better.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
The first is spatial resolution.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
The second is ground sampling distance.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
This is how much a single point of a photo can cover.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
If we compare drone photos, we can get 50 cm by 1 pixel.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
We can see the details of the plant.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
Satellite photos are only 15 m by 1 pixel.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
We can't see what's going on in that area.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
We can only see one point.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
It's bigger than the plant itself.

02:19.000 --> 02:29.000
This is a comparison of drone and satellite photos.

02:29.000 --> 02:45.000
We can see that the satellite photos are more detailed than the drone photos.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
This gives us more information.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
We can make better decisions.

02:49.000 --> 02:58.000
Satellite photos don't stay in the same place forever.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
They move around.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
They stay in the same place for a day.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
It doesn't mean that we get the data that we want.

03:07.000 --> 03:15.000
If it rains heavily that day, we miss the chance to get the data.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
Using a drone allows us to get the data that we want.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
What do we use to collect spatial data?

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
This is a drone video that we developed for spatial research.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
We have seen a drone that can fly up and down.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
The limitation is that it can control the area.

03:57.000 --> 04:04.000
But compared to a drone that can fly up and down, it can control the area more efficiently.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Vettel is a drone that we developed.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
It can fly up and down.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
There are two advantages.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
It uses less space.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
It is easier to work.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
It can fly up and down.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
If you have seen the video of Space X, it is the same.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
It can fly up and down.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
It can change the air.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
It can fly like an airplane.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
It can control the area more efficiently.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
It can be used for spatial research.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
It can be used for urban planning.

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
It can be used to transport small goods.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
The drone is made of carbon fiber.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
It is light and can be used to control the area.

04:53.000 --> 05:01.000
We can install on-board computers to control the communication system.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
Whether it is using 4G or 5G, we can work together with this drone.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
The drone works with Nomad.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
We have a software to plan where to cover the area,

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
how to plan the flight,

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
where to take pictures,

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
and collect the data for further analysis.

05:50.000 --> 06:01.000
Once we have the data, we can use it for analysis.

06:01.000 --> 06:14.000
We can use the data to see whether the area is well-planned.

06:14.000 --> 06:21.000
We can plan the area to make it easier for farmers to work.

06:21.000 --> 06:28.000
We can plan the area to make it easier for farmers to work.

06:28.000 --> 06:37.000
Some agricultural projects require a well-planned area.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
Some agricultural projects require a well-planned area.

06:44.000 --> 07:13.000

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
