0	4000	Our concept is not very high-tech.
4000	12000	We have to pay attention to how we take care of our farmland.
12000	15000	If there are any problems, we always cooperate.
15000	21000	But if we don't have the tools, it's hard to do it.
21000	24000	We plant vegetables in small areas.
24000	31000	But if we do it in a big area, we have to take care of all the plants every day.
31000	35000	Without any tools, it's impossible.
35000	38000	This is where technology comes in handy.
38000	44000	We collect data on plants.
44000	46000	We analyze the data.
46000	55000	From the raw data, we analyze it to understand how our plants are doing.
55000	58000	Once we understand it, how do we respond?
58000	60000	How do we take action?
60000	63000	If there are any problems, how do we solve them?
63000	69000	Then we take action.
70000	76000	This is how we collect data.
76000	78000	This is an example.
78000	80000	This is a photo.
80000	83000	This is a photo of a plant.
83000	88000	We choose to use a drone photo rather than a satellite photo.
88000	92000	Both have different benefits.
92000	94000	Satellites are around the world.
94000	96000	They get data from all over the world.
96000	100000	There are two points where drone photos are better.
100000	105000	The first is spatial resolution.
105000	109000	The second is ground sampling distance.
109000	112000	This is how much a single point of a photo can cover.
112000	118000	If we compare drone photos, we can get 50 cm by 1 pixel.
118000	121000	We can see the details of the plant.
121000	127000	Satellite photos are only 15 m by 1 pixel.
127000	131000	We can't see what's going on in that area.
131000	133000	We can only see one point.
133000	135000	It's bigger than the plant itself.
139000	149000	This is a comparison of drone and satellite photos.
149000	165000	We can see that the satellite photos are more detailed than the drone photos.
165000	167000	This gives us more information.
167000	169000	We can make better decisions.
169000	178000	Satellite photos don't stay in the same place forever.
178000	180000	They move around.
180000	183000	They stay in the same place for a day.
183000	187000	It doesn't mean that we get the data that we want.
187000	195000	If it rains heavily that day, we miss the chance to get the data.
196000	203000	Using a drone allows us to get the data that we want.
207000	212000	What do we use to collect spatial data?
212000	220000	This is a drone video that we developed for spatial research.
226000	233000	We have seen a drone that can fly up and down.
233000	237000	The limitation is that it can control the area.
237000	244000	But compared to a drone that can fly up and down, it can control the area more efficiently.
244000	247000	Vettel is a drone that we developed.
247000	250000	It can fly up and down.
251000	254000	There are two advantages.
254000	256000	It uses less space.
256000	257000	It is easier to work.
257000	258000	It can fly up and down.
258000	261000	If you have seen the video of Space X, it is the same.
261000	262000	It can fly up and down.
262000	264000	It can change the air.
264000	266000	It can fly like an airplane.
266000	268000	It can control the area more efficiently.
268000	272000	It can be used for spatial research.
272000	275000	It can be used for urban planning.
275000	282000	It can be used to transport small goods.
282000	286000	The drone is made of carbon fiber.
286000	292000	It is light and can be used to control the area.
293000	301000	We can install on-board computers to control the communication system.
301000	308000	Whether it is using 4G or 5G, we can work together with this drone.
317000	320000	The drone works with Nomad.
320000	325000	We have a software to plan where to cover the area,
325000	327000	how to plan the flight,
327000	328000	where to take pictures,
328000	331000	and collect the data for further analysis.
350000	361000	Once we have the data, we can use it for analysis.
361000	374000	We can use the data to see whether the area is well-planned.
374000	381000	We can plan the area to make it easier for farmers to work.
381000	388000	We can plan the area to make it easier for farmers to work.
388000	397000	Some agricultural projects require a well-planned area.
398000	404000	Some agricultural projects require a well-planned area.
